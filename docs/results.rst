Simulation Results
====================

Results Structure
-----------------

Simulation results are returned and saved in the
:class:`tsnet.network.model.TransientModel` object
for each node and link in the networks.

Node results include the following attributes:

    - Head [m]
    - Emitter discharge (including leaks and bursts) [:math:`m^3/s`]
    - Actual demand discharge [:math:`m^3/s`]

Link results include the following attributes:

    - Head at start node [m]
    - Flow velocity at start node [:math:`m^3/s`]
    - Flow rate at start node [:math:`m^3/s`]
    - Head at end node [m]
    - Flow velocity at end node [:math:`m^3/s`]
    - Flow rate at end node [:math:`m^3/s`]


The result for each attribute is a Numpy array, representing the time
history of the simulation results, the length of
which equals the total number of simulation time steps (:math:`tn`).

For example, the results of head, emitter discharge and demand discharge
at node 'JUNCTION-105' can be accessed by:

.. code:: python

  node = tm.get_node['JUNCTION-105']
  head = node.head
  emitter_discharge = node.emitter_discharge
  demand_discharge = node.demand_discharge

To obtain the results on pipe 'LINK-40':

.. code:: python

  pipe = tm.get_link('LINK-40')
  start_head = pipe.start_node_head
  end_head = pipe.end_node_head
  start_velocity = pipe.start_node_velocity
  end_velocity = pipe.end_node_velocity
  start_flowrate = pipe.start_node_flowrate
  end_flowrate = pipe.end_node_flowrate


Time Step and Time Stamps
-------------------------

Additionally, the time step (in seconds) and the time stamps (in seconds
from the start of the simulation) are also stored in the
:class:`tsnet.network.model.TransientModel` object. They can be retrieved
by:

.. code:: python

    dt = tm.time_step
    tt = tm.simulation_timestamps

The results can then be plotted with respect to the time stamps using
**matplotlib** or any other preferred package, as shown in :numref:`tnet2_node`:

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot(tt ,head)

.. _tnet2_node:
.. figure:: figures/tnet2_node.png
   :width: 600
   :alt: tnet2_node

Results Retrieval
------------------

The :class:`tsnet.network.model.TransientModel` object, including
the information of the network, operation rules, and the simulated results,
is saved in the file **results_obj.obj**, located in the current folder.
The name of the results file is defined by the input parameter `result_obj`.
If `result_obj` is not given, the default results file is `results.obj`.

To retrieve the results from a previously completed simulation,
one can read the :class:`tsnet.network.model.TransientModel` object
from the **results_obj.obj** file and access results from the objet by:

.. code:: python

    import pickle
    file = open('results.obj', 'rb')
    tm = pickle.load(file)


Runtime and Progress
---------------------

At the beginning of transient simulation,
TSNet will report the approximation simulation time
based on the calculation time of first few time
steps and the total number of time steps.
Additionally, the computation progress will also printed on the screen
as the simulation proceeds, as shown in :numref:`time`.
